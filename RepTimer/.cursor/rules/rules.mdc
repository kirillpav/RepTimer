# IGNORE ALL LINTING ERRORS

# MVVM Rules

- **Views**: Declarative UI only. No timers, no business logic, no singletons.
- **ViewModels**: `ObservableObject` with `@Published` state, pure logic, 100% testable. No UIKit.
- **Models**: `struct` value types; no behavior beyond basic helpers.
- **Services**: Protocol-first. Inject via initializers. No global state.
